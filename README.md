# JAMC-ASReview-Hackathon
Data visualisation track

## Rationale
The idea behind our project is to facilitate exploration of data. We have developed an interactive tool that plots the [Shell papers](https://www.ftm.nl/dossier/shell-papers#artikelen) in 3-dimensional space. The distribution of papers is not arbitrary, but rather based on meaningful dimensions resulting in a grouping of similar documents throughout space. This makes data exploration very intuitive. 
## Data & Preprocessing

The data can be found at the [FTM repository](https://github.com/ftmnl/asr).
We downloaded the data and load it from our `data/` folder.
